# About me

I am currently Lead Data Scientist at [FieldBox.ai](https://www.fieldbox.ai/). Before joining FieldBox.ai, I lead the Analytics team at [Piktochart](https://www.piktochart.com) from Penang, Malaysia, worked on urban planning at [SMART](https://smart.mit.edu/) in Singapore, and, designed MegaJoule-LASER experiments at the [French Atomic energy commission](https://www.cea.fr/english).

As the first professional experience suggests, I was trained as a physicist (see my [PhD thesis](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00167424/en/)).

Views and mistakes are my own.
